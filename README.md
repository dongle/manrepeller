Man Repeller is a collection of things that repel men.
Idea from the fabulous fashion blog, The Man Repeller (http://www.manrepeller.com/) started by the inordinately stylish Leandra Medine. As she so aptly stated:
"Good fashion is about pleasing women, not men, so as it happens, the trends that we love, men hate. And that is fantastic."

First up, Man Repeller colors for your ITerm. Why does pink and green repel men? As it turns out, statistically men are more likely to be color blind than women. So if someone _ahem_ is peering over your shoulder telling you that you're doing something the "wrong way" and "that's not how they would do it" maybe you need to repel those men with bright colors and text that is completely unreadable because it's green on pink.



Please contribute to this repo with other delightful tools of man repelling.
